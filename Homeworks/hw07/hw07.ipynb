    "Say we have a high roller, Brian Hang, who wants to win a lot of money. Instead of flipping 1 coin each game, he flips 100 coins during each game. Since he is flipping so many coins, the casino decides to give him a better payout: if a coin lands on heads, Brian recieves \\$9.99, if it lands on tail, Brian loses \\$10.00. Now suppose that Brian, a very *sneaky* high roller, replaces the coins so that all the coins being flipped are biased to have a 50.1% chance of landing on heads. The people in the casino probably will not be able to notice that this coin is biased. To make matters worse, all the casino employees just finished reviewing some beers, so their judgment skills are in peril anyway. "
